Finding Best Fit Line model coefficients using Gradient Descent (from finding optimal values to Loss function visualization)


# Problem Statement
To find the **“optimal values”** of the **model coefficients (slope w1 and intercept w0)** of **best-fit line**, such that the **“Mean Squared Error (MSE)"** is minimum.

    Also, Static and Interactive Visualization for:
    1. MSE Loss function (y-axis) vs w0 (x-axis)
    2. MSE Loss function (y-axis) vs w1 (x-axis)
    3. 3D-plot of Loss function w.r.t. w0 & w1
    4. w0 (y-axis) vs Iteration (x-axis)
    5. w1 (y-axis) vs Iteration (x-axis)
    6. Loss function (y-axis) vs iteration (x-axis)

# Approach
The approach involves utilizing the **Gradient Descent Algorithm**, with the steps and mathematical formulas described in detail in the Problem statement document.

# Outcome
- Demonstrated the use of Gradient Descent Algorithm to find the optimal values of model coefficients of best-fit line. 
- Showcased the **relationships between different factors** such as the MSE Loss function and the model coefficients (w0 and w1) through dynamic and interactive visualization.
